# Lincense-Plate-Recognition using Voice Recognized Input

This repository is based on an automated voice recognition and license plate recognition project. The model recognizes the input through the microphone and uses that input image to extract the license plate and finds out the number. Different numbers of digits (0-9) can be recognized after training with a basic neural network model and license plate recognition is based on computer vision techniques. 

In the Neural Network section, most of the calculation was done from the scratch rather than taking helps of the function.
